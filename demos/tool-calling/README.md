## Overview

The Tool Calling project is focused on testing the reliability and accuracy of tool-calling operations, particularly in the context of weather data retrieval. The project includes integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios to verify the system's ability to correctly interpret and respond to weather-related prompts.

## Usage

To start the project locally, ensure that all dependencies are installed and run the following command from the root of the project directory:

```bash
npx nx test tool-calling
```

This command will execute the integration tests defined in the `integration.test.ts` file, which include scenarios for identifying weather conditions in different cities.

### NPM Scripts

- `test tool-calling`: Runs the integration tests for the tool-calling project.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Tool Calling project is designed to support robust testing of tool-calling functionalities. The integration tests are structured to simulate interactions with a server that processes weather-related prompts and returns appropriate responses.

```

The diagram illustrates the flow of data from the client to the local server, where the `Weather Worker` processes prompts to fetch and return weather data.

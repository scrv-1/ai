# Structured Output

This project is designed to test the structured output of a local development server. It includes integration tests to ensure that the server returns the correct JSON object structure.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to validate the structured output of a local development server. It uses integration tests to ensure that the server returns JSON objects that match a predefined schema. The project is built using Vitest for testing and Zod for schema validation.

## Usage

To start the project locally and run the integration tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx nx test structured-output
```

### NPM Scripts

- **test**: Runs the integration tests to validate the server's structured output.

### API Interaction

The project interacts with a local development server API. Below is the API call used in the tests:

- **Endpoint**: `/`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
    	"prompt": "Create a recipe for sourdough bread."
    }
    ```
- **Response Format**:
    ```json
    {
    	"recipe": {
    		"name": "string",
    		"ingredients": [{ "name": "string", "amount": "string" }],
    		"steps": ["string"]
    	}
    }
    ```
- **Curl Command**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"prompt": "Create a recipe for sourdough bread."}' \
      http://localhost:3000/
    ```

## Architecture

The project is structured as an application that tests the output of a local server. It uses the following components:

- **Local Dev Server**: The smoke test starts the app locally before making requests.
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that validate the server's response against a predefined schema using Zod.

This project does not use LLMs or AI, so no agentic patterns are highlighted.

## Overview

The Tool Calling Stream Traditional project is built to demonstrate the integration of AI models with external tools in a serverless environment. The primary functionality is to process user prompts, determine the appropriate tool to use, and fetch weather information for a specified location. The architecture is designed to handle requests efficiently using Cloudflare Workers and the Hono framework.

## Usage

To start the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npx nx dev tool-calling-stream-traditional
```

### NPM Scripts

- **deploy**: Deploys the application using Wrangler.
    ```bash
    npx nx deploy tool-calling-stream-traditional
    ```
- **dev**: Starts the development server using Wrangler.
    ```bash
    npx nx dev tool-calling-stream-traditional
    ```
- **lint**: Lints the source code using oxlint.
    ```bash
    npx nx lint tool-calling-stream-traditional
    ```
- **start**: Alias for the dev script.
    ```bash
    npx nx start tool-calling-stream-traditional
    ```
- **test**: Runs the test suite using Vitest.
    ```bash
    npx nx test tool-calling-stream-traditional
    ```
- **test:ci**: Runs the test suite in CI mode using Vitest.
    ```bash
    npx nx test:ci tool-calling-stream-traditional
    ```
- **type-check**: Performs TypeScript type checking.
    ```bash
    npx nx type-check tool-calling-stream-traditional
    ```

### API Interaction

The project exposes an API endpoint to interact with the AI model and tools.

#### POST /

- **Request**:
    - **Body**: `{ "prompt": "<user_prompt>" }`
- **Response**:
    - **Body**: Weather information based on the specified location.

**Example cURL Command**:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "What's the weather in London?"}' \
  http://localhost:8787/
```

## Architecture

The architecture of the Tool Calling Stream Traditional project is centered around serverless principles, utilizing Cloudflare Workers and the Hono framework to handle HTTP requests and interact with AI models.

### System Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User] -->|HTTP Request| B[Cloudflare Worker]
    B -->|Invoke| C[AI Model]
    C -->|Fetch| D[Weather Tool]
    D -->|Return| B
    B -->|HTTP Response| A
```

### Tool Use Pattern

This project employs the Tool Use Pattern, where the AI model dynamically interacts with external tools to extend its capabilities. In this case, the AI model identifies the need to fetch weather information and invokes the appropriate tool to obtain the data.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[AI Model] -->|Identify Task| B[Weather Tool]
    B -->|Fetch Data| C[Weather API]
    C -->|Return Data| B
    B -->|Integrate Data| A
```

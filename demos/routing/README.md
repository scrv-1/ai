## Overview

The Routing project is designed to process and evaluate prompts using AI models. It uses a workflow to grade the complexity of a prompt and then generates a detailed response. The project leverages Cloudflare Workers and AI models to perform these tasks efficiently.

## Usage

To start the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npx nx dev routing
```

### NPM Scripts

- **deploy**: Deploys the application using Wrangler.
    ```bash
    npx nx deploy routing
    ```
- **dev**: Starts the development server using Wrangler.
    ```bash
    npx nx dev routing
    ```
- **lint**: Lints the source code using oxlint.
    ```bash
    npx nx lint routing
    ```
- **start**: Alias for `dev`, starts the development server.
    ```bash
    npx nx start routing
    ```
- **test**: Runs the test suite using Vitest.
    ```bash
    npx nx test routing
    ```
- **test:ci**: Runs the test suite in CI mode using Vitest.
    ```bash
    npx nx test:ci routing
    ```
- **type-check**: Performs TypeScript type checking.
    ```bash
    npx nx type-check routing
    ```

### API Endpoints

- **POST /**: Creates a new routing workflow instance.
    - **Request**:
        ```json
        {
        	"prompt": "Your prompt here"
        }
        ```
    - **Response**:
        ```json
        {
        	"id": "instance-id",
        	"details": "status-details"
        }
        ```
    - **Curl Command**:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Your prompt here"}'
        ```

- **GET /:id**: Retrieves the status of a routing workflow instance.
    - **Response**:
        ```json
        {
        	"status": "status-details"
        }
        ```
    - **Curl Command**:
        ```bash
        curl http://localhost:8787/{id}
        ```

## Architecture

The project is structured as a cloud-based application using Cloudflare Workers. It employs a routing workflow to process prompts and generate responses. The architecture includes AI models for evaluating and responding to prompts.

    A[Client] -->|POST /| B[Cloudflare Worker]
    B -->|Evaluate Prompt| C[AI Model]
    C -->|Generate Response| D[Cloudflare Worker]
    D -->|Return Response| A
```

### Agentic Design Patterns

#### Routing

This project uses the Routing pattern to classify and direct tasks based on the complexity of the input prompt. It evaluates the prompt and selects the appropriate AI model to generate a response.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Prompt] -->|Evaluate Complexity| B{Routing Decision}
    B -->|Complex| C[Large AI Model]
    B -->|Simple| D[Small AI Model]
    C -->|Generate Response| E[Output]
    D -->|Generate Response| E[Output]
```

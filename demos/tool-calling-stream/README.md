## Overview

The Tool Calling Stream project serves as a streaming interface for AI models, enabling them to interact with external tools in real-time. The primary functionality includes processing user prompts and executing tasks like retrieving weather data. The architecture is built using the Hono framework, with AI models provided by Workers AI.

## Usage

To start the project locally, use the following command:

```
npx nx dev tool-calling-stream
```

This command runs the project in development mode using Wrangler.

### NPM Scripts

- **deploy**: Deploys the project using Wrangler.
    ```
    npx nx deploy tool-calling-stream
    ```
- **dev**: Starts the project in development mode.
    ```
    npx nx dev tool-calling-stream
    ```
- **lint**: Lints the source code using oxlint.
    ```
    npx nx lint tool-calling-stream
    ```
- **start**: Alias for `dev`, starts the project in development mode.
    ```
    npx nx start tool-calling-stream
    ```
- **test**: Runs the test suite using Vitest.
    ```
    npx nx test tool-calling-stream
    ```
- **test:ci**: Runs the test suite in CI mode.
    ```
    npx nx test:ci tool-calling-stream
    ```
- **type-check**: Performs TypeScript type checking.
    ```
    npx nx type-check tool-calling-stream
    ```

### API Usage

The project exposes an API with the following endpoints:

#### POST /

- **Description**: Processes a user prompt and returns a streaming response.
- **Request Format**:
    ```json
    {
    	"prompt": "What is the weather in London?"
    }
    ```
- **Response Format**: Streaming response with weather information.
- **Curl Command**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"prompt": "What is the weather in London?"}' \
      http://localhost:8787/
    ```

## Architecture

The architecture of the Tool Calling Stream project is designed to facilitate real-time interaction between AI models and external tools. The system is built using the Hono framework and integrates with Workers AI for model execution.

    C -->|Executes Task| D[External Tool];
    D -->|Returns Result| B;
    B -->|Streams Response| A;
```

### Agentic Patterns

The project utilizes the **Tool Use Pattern**, where the AI model dynamically interacts with external tools to extend its capabilities. This pattern involves identifying tasks, invoking appropriate tools, and integrating returned data into the workflow.

# ai-gateway-provider

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#658](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/658) [`1bffec5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/1bffec556c574a20fc79afd5c30d04dc58415578) Thanks [@superhighfives](https://github.com/superhighfives)! - Require an OpenAI-compatible provider version that preserves Gemini thought signatures across unified tool-call turns.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#601](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/601) [`7a6f8dd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/7a6f8ddac6c38483da023201303b53d10c266860) Thanks [@OskarLebuda](https://github.com/OskarLebuda)! - Add support for AI SDK 7

  Bumps peer dependencies to require `ai@^7` and `@ai-sdk/provider@^4`. This is a breaking change for users on AI SDK 6, who should stay on the previous major version of these packages.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#590](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/590) [`fe0d182`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/fe0d182d18fd058f562973d4d0b22312aa9a9c25) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - New gateway options, plus the provider routing table and `cf-aig-*` header
  building are now shared with the `workers-ai-provider` AI Gateway delegate
  (bundled inline — no new dependency), so the two stay in lockstep.

  - `AiGatewayOptions` gains two universal-endpoint controls: `byokAlias`
    (`cf-aig-byok-alias`, select a stored BYOK key by alias) and `zdr`
    (`cf-aig-zdr`, per-request Zero Data Retention override for Unified Billing).
  - Cache controls now emit the current `cf-aig-cache-ttl` / `cf-aig-skip-cache`
    header names instead of the upstream-deprecated `cf-cache-ttl` / `cf-skip-cache`.
  - New opt-in **resumable streaming** on the binding/run path (**coming soon** —
    not generally available yet while the AI Gateway resume backend rolls out;
    treat as experimental): pass `resume`
    (`{ binding: env.AI, gateway, onResumeExpired?, maxReconnects? }`) and a
    streaming run that surfaces a `cf-aig-run-id` will transparently reconnect on a
    transient mid-stream drop, reusing the same resumable-stream engine as the
    `workers-ai-provider` delegate. No-op on the REST/API-key path and on
    non-streaming calls.
  - The misspelled `retries` option type is renamed `AiGatewayReties` →
    `AiGatewayRetries`; the old name stays exported as a deprecated alias, so this
    is non-breaking.

  Existing behavior is otherwise unchanged.

## 3.1.3

## 3.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#457](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/457) [`cc94a06`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/cc94a06ca85603e473f41cc12ed83f53cbe9e136) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix request cancellation by propagating `abortSignal` to outbound network calls.

  **ai-gateway-provider**: Pass `abortSignal` to the `fetch` call (API path) and to `binding.run()` (binding path) so that cancelled requests are properly aborted.

  **workers-ai-provider**: Pass `abortSignal` to `binding.run()` for chat, embedding, and image models, matching the existing behavior in transcription, speech, and reranking models.

  **@cloudflare/tanstack-ai**: Pass `signal` through to `binding.run()` in both `createGatewayFetch` (AI Gateway binding path) and `createWorkersAiBindingFetch` (Workers AI binding path).
